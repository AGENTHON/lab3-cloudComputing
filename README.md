# lab3-cloudComputing
This is part of our evaluation for the course CLoud Computing
The goal is to :
- Create an AWS application in which a client submits a request to a worker on EC2. The request is
composed of a list of integers.
- The EC2 worker is a Python application that receives the list (the request) and calculates the min, max,
mean, median and send them back to the client.
- After sending the response, the EC2 worker must write a log file describing this transaction as txt file
on S3 Amazon Storage Cloud.
